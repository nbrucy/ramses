# Movies

The block named `&MOVIE_PARAMS` contains the parameters related to the movies. One can produce up to 5 movies, which center at different parts of the simulation box and have various camera behavior (see example blocks in the bottom). 

The movie routine is very useful for creating on the fly visualizations of a simulation with a small time step between frames, without having to write and process many huge snapshots for that. For turning the binary images created by this routine into a movie that can be watched on any media player, check out [RAM](https://bitbucket.org/biernacki/ram).

This will result in 1000 frames 1920x1080 (Full HD) between starting redshift and z=0. Values for `xcentre_frame`, `ycentre_frame` and `zcentre_frame` come from fitting the spline coefficients with `utils/py/get_spline_coeffs.py` (it requires previous run of the same setup with clump finder; e.g. DM-only). Size of the frame will be reflecting physical units (e.g. delta_x=deltax_frame[0]+deltax_frame[1]/a; where a is the explansion factor). Frames are going to be projected along the z axis and projections of dark matter density, stellar density, temperature, gas density and var6 (extra variable, here metallicity) will be saved.

Same variables as for the cosmological run are going to be saved with the same resolution. Here, the camera is always centred at the centre of the box (assuming boxlen=10) and encompasses volume of 10% x 10% x 10% of the box. Tendmovie is set in the code units of time.
