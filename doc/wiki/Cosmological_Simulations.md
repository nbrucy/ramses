# Cosmological simulations

In this section, we describe in more detail how ramses can be used to 
perform cosmological simulations. Useful concepts related to parallel 
computing or post-processing will be introduced, and can also be used 
for non-cosmological runs. Cosmological simulations are performed by
specifying `cosmo=.true.` in the `&RUN_PARAMS` namelist block.
